    <p class="paras" id="about-para">Hi! My name is Rahimin Mohammed. I'm 17 years old, I'm your typical brown bengali boy living in Queens, New York a.k.a "<span class="italics">The World's Borough</span>", and I currently attend the specialized high school Queen's High School for the Sciences at York College. I have several hobbies I am passionate about in my free time such as reading webnovels, reading webtoons, listening to music, watching anime, browsing Reddit, playing mobile games, etc. Just generally being chronically online 24/7. I have recently taken an interest in coding and hope to advance further in this subject.</p>
